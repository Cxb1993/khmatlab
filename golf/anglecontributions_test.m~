function ac = anglecontributions_test(gm, states);
% Function to test the anglecontribution function on a simpler
% model with only a single chain. 
%  ac = anglecontributions(gm, states, endpoint);
% Function that calculates each angles contribution to the end point
% velocity. This is taken as the velocity of the CoM of the
% last segment. See build_golf_model for the definition of
% this point.
% Let p(theta) = g(theta)p_0 be the function that gives the
% position of the end point as a function of the joint angles
% (and other generalized coordinates). The contribution is
% then calculated as the derivative of this function w.r.t
% each joint angle. The resulting expression expresses the
% infinitesimal change in the end point position for an
% infinitesimal change in the joint angle, i.e. a vector. This
% vector is multiplied with the actual joint angle velocity,
% and then projected onto the direction of the actual velocity
% of the end point.
%
% Input
%    gm       ->  model struct
%    states   ->  matrix (nsts x nfrs) with the estimated states of
%                 the model.
% Output
%    ac       ->  (nst x nfrs) matrix containing the contributions
%                 of each joint angle ( generalized coordinate).
